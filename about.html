            <h3>Our Beginnings</h3>
            <p>
              In the heart of the French countryside, our story began in this humble yet charming kitchen. It was here, amidst the crackling of the wood-fired oven and the aroma of freshly baked bread, that the first recipes were crafted. Every detail—from the stone hearth to the handcrafted wooden tables—carries the essence of a time when meals were made with love and care, shared among family and friends. This dedication to authenticity inspires us to this day.
